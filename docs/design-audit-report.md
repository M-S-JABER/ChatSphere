# Design Audit Summary

## Layout & Structure
- Introduced a responsive shell that swaps between a split-pane conversation view on desktop and a focused single-pane flow on mobile.
- Added a mobile-friendly back navigation inside the chat header and ensured the conversation list occupies the full viewport height without double scrollbars.
- Standardised panel backgrounds with subtle translucency and blur to create separation while maintaining visual cohesion.

## Navigation & Actions
- Centralised global actions (settings, theme toggle, account menu) into consistent header slots so they remain discoverable on both desktop and mobile.
- Expanded conversation controls with clearly grouped buttons for creating chats, toggling archived state, and managing pinned conversations.

## Messaging Experience
- Reworked message bubbles with balanced padding, a 24px border radius, and improved typography for better readability.
- Normalised attachment treatments (thumbnails, file cards, placeholders) and introduced skeleton/loading states with accessible messaging.
- Aligned timestamps and status icons, ensuring consistent spacing regardless of message direction or content mix.

## Inputs & Interactions
- Polished the composer toolbar with unified icon sizing, colour transitions, and focus styles; textarea now inherits consistent placeholder styling and focus rings.
- Enhanced search and list controls with rounded inputs, defined focus states, and responsive icon/button alignment.

## Responsiveness & Accessibility
- Added media-query driven rendering logic so mobile users see either the thread or the list, never cramped side-by-side content.
- Ensured key actions remain reachable at smaller breakpoints, while desktop users retain a multi-column workspace.
- Maintained contrast ratios and provided clear hover/focus feedback across interactive elements.
